version 0.005; 2023-03-13

  * port chat2.pl and validate.pl to Perl 5.19.8, which abolished the
    "do" syntax for subroutine calls, after it had started warning by
    default in Perl 5.11.1

  * port abbrev.pl, bigfloat.pl, bigint.pl, bigrat.pl, cacheout.pl,
    chat2.pl, complete.pl, exceptions.pl, ftp.pl, getcwd.pl, pwd.pl,
    and syslog.pl to Perl 5.37.9, which deprecated the old "'" package
    separator

  * muffle ambiguity warnings that arose under -w from ambiguous use of
    keywords "open", "close", and "select"

  * make the tests in t/timelocal.t robust against the way
    Time::Local::time{local,gm}() interpret year inputs 0 to 99 based
    on a sliding window

  * make the tests in t/timelocal.t accommodate OS-dependent limits on
    the range of years that can be represented in a time_t

  * update chat2.pl, ftp.pl, and syslog.pl to get constants from
    the Socket and Sys::Syslog modules, rather than from socket.ph,
    sys/socket.ph, and syslog.ph, which may well not be available

  * test that all the library files can be loaded without causing
    unintended warnings

  * update usage comments in getopt.pl, getopts.pl, stat.pl, syslog.pl,
    and validate.pl for Perl 5.19.8, which abolished the "do" syntax
    for subroutine calls

  * document that the core try/catch mechanism (from Perl 5.33.7) is
    another alternative to exceptions.pl

  * in t/timelocal.t, apply most tests to both timelocal() and timegm()

  * in t/timelocal.t, test error for 2100-02-29

  * in t/timelocal.t, don't load the unused Config module

version 0.004; 2017-07-30

  * in doc, note when core versions started warning and were removed

  * no longer include a Makefile.PL in the distribution

  * in META.{yml,json}, point to public bug tracker

  * include META.json in distribution

  * correct a typo in documentation

  * convert .cvsignore to .gitignore

  * add MYMETA.json to .cvsignore

version 0.003; 2011-03-18

  * bugfix: in shellwords.pl, require Text::ParseWords 3.25, because
    earlier versions have a bug that causes an infinite loop on some
    inputs

  * use full stricture in test suite

  * in Build.PL, complete declaration of configure-time requirements

  * in Build.PL, declare appropriate version on Module::Build dependency

version 0.002; 2010-05-19

  * remove all uses of $[, both reads and writes, from library code,
    where it has been obsolete since perl 5.000

  * for option parsing libraries, test behaviour with "--" argument

  * in t/shellwords.t, remove unnecessary timeout that caused false
    test failures

  * in test suite, consistently use strictures and Test::More

  * revise test code style

version 0.001; 2010-04-10

  * revise statement about deprecation of the modules, to be more complete
    and accurate and to reflect the latest nuances to their status

  * in documentation, list the bundled libraries, with very short
    descriptions

  * add tests for several of the libraries based on the core's tests for
    more modern replacements: abbrev.pl from Text::Abbrev, getopt.pl
    and getopts.pl from Getopt::Std, hostname.pl from Sys::Hostname,
    open2.pl from IPC::Open2, open3.pl from IPC::Open3, shellwords.pl
    from Text::ParseWords, timelocal.pl from Time::Local

  * in titular version-number-supplying module, check for required Perl
    version at runtime

version 0.000; 2010-03-30

  * initial released version
